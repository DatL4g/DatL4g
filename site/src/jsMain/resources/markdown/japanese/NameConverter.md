# Japanese Name Converter

This tool converts your name directly into **katakana** and **romaji**.

> [!NOTE]

## Why Katakana?

The converter outputs **Katakana** instead of Hiragana.  
This is intentional, because in Japanese **foreign names and words** are usually written in Katakana.

- **Hiragana (ひらがな)** is mainly used for native Japanese words, grammar, and particles.
- **Katakana (カタカナ)** is used for loanwords, foreign names, and emphasis.

Since this tool focuses on **converting non-Japanese names into Japanese script**, Katakana is the correct and natural choice.
