# Projects

A collection of projects Iâ€™ve built, ranging from developer tooling to end-user apps.  
Each project has a parent description and detailed module pages.

- [Sekret](#sekret)
  - [Secrets](projects/sekret/Secrets.md)
  - [Logging](projects/sekret/Logging.md)
- [Tolgee](#tolgee-kotlin-multiplatform-sdk)
  - [Core](projects/tolgee/Core.md)
  - [Compose](projects/tolgee/Compose.md)
- [Mimasu](#mimasu)
  - [Build your own](projects/mimasu/Building.md)

This collection currently only covers my own repositories, however I contributed to a much more open source projects.

## [Sekret](projects/Sekret.md)

A lightweight Kotlin library for handling sensitive data and structured logging in a clean, developer-friendly way.

- **[Secrets](projects/sekret/Secrets.md):** Manage and inject application secrets safely, with consistent patterns.
- **[Logging](projects/sekret/Logging.md):** Flexible structured logging designed to reduce boilerplate and make logs more useful.

**Repository:** https://github.com/DatL4g/Sekret

## [Tolgee Kotlin Multiplatform SDK](projects/Tolgee.md)

A **Kotlin Multiplatform SDK** for integrating [Tolgee](https://tolgee.io/) localization into modern apps.  
Built because existing localization tools lacked true multiplatform support and Compose integration.

- **[Core SDK](projects/tolgee/Core.md):** Provides base functionality for translations across all supported platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, JVM, Linux, MinGW, JS, WASM JS).
- **[Compose](projects/tolgee/Compose.md):** Seamless integration with **Compose Multiplatform**, enabling dynamic localization in declarative UIs.

**Repository:** https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-kotlin-sdk

## [Mimasu](projects/Mimasu.md)

A sleek movie and TV guide app available on **Google Play**, focused on great UX and discoverability.  
Supports extensions so streaming services like Netflix or Crunchyroll could integrate directly in the app.

- **[Build your own](projects/mimasu/Building.md)** You can build your own extension!
- **[App Overview](projects/Mimasu.md):** Full details about the app, its UX design, screenshots, and extension system.
- **[Google Play Listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.datlag.mimasu):** Install the app and try it yourself.
